Collabify is a modern, feature-rich project management tool designed to help teams plan, organize, and collaborate seamlessly. Built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (as a full-stack framework), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and powered by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), Collabify provides a great user experience with beautiful UI components and smooth animations via [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

One of the key features is secure authentication using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), which is integrated using both Regular Web Applications (RWA) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) credentials. MongoDB is used as the primary database to store projects and tasks.

This will provide you with a user-friendly interface to explore the available endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later) installed
- **npm** or **Yarn** installed
- A **MongoDB** instance or a MongoDB Atlas account
- An **Auth0** account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collabify.git
   cd collabify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a file called `.env.local` in the root directory and add the following variables (adjust values as needed):

```
AUTH0_SECRET=your_auth0_secret_here
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://yourapi.example.com/
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_ID=your_m2m_client_id
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_SECRET=your_m2m_client_secret
AUTH0_TENANT_DOMAIN=your-auth0-tenant-domain.auth0.com
```

## Auth0 Setup Guide

Follow these steps to configure Auth0 for Collabify:

### 1. Setting Up Your Auth0 Tenant

1. **Sign Up/Log In:**  
   Visit [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and sign up or log in.

2. **Create a New Tenant:**  
   If you donâ€™t already have a tenant, create one. For example, use a name like `dev-collabify`.

3. **Note Your Domain:**  
   In the Auth0 Dashboard, your domain will look like `dev-ywgxp8dwn5jtlj3a.us.auth0.com`. Use this domain in your environment variables (see above).

### 2. Creating the Regular Web Application (RWA)

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to **Applications > Applications**.
2. Click **Create Application**.
3. **Name your application:** e.g., "Collabify RWA".
4. **Select Application Type:** Choose **Regular Web Applications**.
5. **Configure Allowed URLs:**

- **Allowed Callback URLs:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
- **Allowed Logout URLs:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Allowed Web Origins:** `http://localhost:3000`

6. **Save your settings.**
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into your `.env.local` as `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### 3. Creating the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Application

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to **Applications > Applications**.
2. Click **Create Application**.
3. **Name your application:** e.g., "Collabify M2M".
4. **Select Application Type:** Choose **Machine to Machine Applications**.
5. **Authorize Access:**  
   Under **APIs**, authorize your API (created in the next step) with the necessary scopes.
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into your `.env.local` as `AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### 4. Configuring Your Auth0 API and Client Grants

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to **APIs**.
2. Click **Create API**.
3. **Name your API:** e.g., "Collabify API".
4. **Identifier:** Set it to `https://myapp.example.com/` (this will be your audience, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`).
5. **Signing Algorithm:** Choose **RS256**.
6. Save your API.
7. In your M2M application settings (from step 3), grant it the required scopes to interact with this API (e.g., `read:users`, `update:users`, `read:roles`, etc.).
8. Now your Auth0 setup is complete.

### 5. Testing the Application

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:** Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Sign Up/Log In:** Use the login button to authenticate with Auth0. You should be redirected to the Auth0 login page. Upon successful login, you will be redirected back to your application, automatically.

## Deployment

Collabify is built with Next.js, so itâ€™s optimized for platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). For deployment:

1. **Push your code to GitHub (or your preferred Git provider).**
2. **Connect your repository to Vercel.**
3. **Set up your environment variables on Vercel:**  
   Use the same values as in your `.env.local`.
4. **Deploy your project.**

For other platforms, refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
